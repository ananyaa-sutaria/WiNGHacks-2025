#GatorGuide 

#Description: GatorGuide is a student-developed application designed to assist STEM students in organizing their academic endeavors. GatorGuide allows students to access several STEM resources on campus from one online location. The application features information concerning both large and small STEM organizations on campus, with links to websites, calendars, and more. Students will be able to track upcoming events and find a place where they truly belong on campus, surrounded by like-minded individuals, without feeling overwhelmed by dozens of flyers and social media posts.

In addition, GatorGuide features a scholarship finder, where users can search for scholarships based on their demographics, interests, and more. Many students rely on scholarships to fund their education, and our website features niche scholarships that users can easily apply for and track due dates.

GatorGuide also contains KAPA, an artificially-powered tool available for students to ask for guidance and homework questions!

#Usage Examples: When a student comes onto campus, they might be curious about the different opportunities presented by their University. GatorGuide is designed to easily introduce students to the various student organizations that might appeal to their interests and future careers. Along with that, students can also use the scholarship search engine to research scholarships that correspond with their demographics and future aspirations and endeavors. The last future is the ChatBot which students can ask STEM-related questions for a quick and easy response.
